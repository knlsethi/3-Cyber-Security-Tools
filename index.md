## CLICKJACKING ASSIGNMENT 

Clickjacking is a type of security threat in which an adversary makes the user click on a link involuntarily without his/her knowledge about  what the link is supposed to do.

A clickjacking page is created such that the user unintentionally downloads a malicious file.
This is achieved using a transparent layer(iframe) laid upon a bottom layer which the user perceives he is clicking.
